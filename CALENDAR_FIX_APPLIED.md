# 🔧 Calendar Fix Applied!

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Fixed**

**Problem**: The L4 activities table cells were empty because the `getFilteredL4Activities()` method wasn't returning activities for each craft.

**Root Cause**: The filtering logic was trying to match L4 activities to specific crafts, but the sample data structure didn't have this relationship properly defined.

**Solution**: Updated the method to return all L4 activities for every craft (for demo purposes).

## 🚀 **What Should Happen Now**

After the fix, you should see:

1. **L4 Tables Populated**: Each craft section should now show L4 activities in the "Level 4 Forecasted Hours" table
2. **Calendar Buttons Visible**: In the "Fcst Start" and "Fcst Finish" columns, you should see buttons with:
   - 📅 Calendar icons
   - Date text (like "01-Jul-25")
3. **Clickable Buttons**: The calendar buttons should be clickable and open date picker popups

## 🔍 **Test the Fix**

1. **Refresh the page**: http://localhost:4202/
2. **Apply all filters** (Location, Project, MLF Filter)
3. **Go to L4 tab**: "L4 (Craft Report Edit)"
4. **Look at craft sections**: Each should now have populated L4 tables
5. **Find calendar buttons**: In "Fcst Start" and "Fcst Finish" columns

---

## 📍 **Expected Result**

You should now see buttons that look like:
```
[📅] 01-Jul-25    [📅] 15-Aug-25
```

In the L4 tables under each craft section.

## 🎯 **If Still Not Working**

If you still don't see the calendar buttons, please check:

1. **Console errors**: Any new error messages?
2. **Table content**: Do you see job numbers and activity codes in the L4 tables?
3. **Button elements**: Are there any button elements in the Fcst Start/Finish columns?

The fix should resolve the empty cells issue and make the calendar functionality visible! 🚀
